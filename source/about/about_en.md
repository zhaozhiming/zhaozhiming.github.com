# Project Experience

## AI Security Platform

Tech Stack: LangChain, OpenAI API, Function calling, Next.js, Node.js, TypeScript, Python

This is an AI security system that incorporates multiple security tools. Users input natural language, and the system executes corresponding tools based on user requests, providing results in different formats.

My main responsibilities include initial framework setup, core feature development, and deployment of the system.

## Knowledge Base AI Question-Answering System

Tech Stack: LangChain, ChatGLM2, React, Node.js, TypeScript, Python

This is an AI-based knowledge base question-answering system that utilizes RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) technology, allowing large language models to search for relevant materials when answering user questions, reducing hallucinations.

My main responsibilities include local deployment of large language models and backend system development.

## AI mini Projects

Technology stack: chatgpt, langchain, prompt engineering, chatglm, vector db, next.js, AI SDK, nest.js, vercel

Several AI projects:

- A chatgpt-based website, developed using the openai API, with the front-end built on next.js and the back-end on nest.js.
- An AI-powered legal consultation service using LLM, developed using prompt engineering and chatgpt, with next.js AI SDK, and deployed on vercel (https://next-lawqa.vercel.app/).

I am primarily responsible for project architecture design, core feature development, and other related tasks.

## Pipeline

Technology stack: tekton, Node.js, Typescript, Docker, K8s

This is a CI/CD platform based on Tekton that helps users quickly set up CI/CD pipelines for containerized and host deployments.

I am primarily responsible for feature design, development, design reviews, code reviews, and other related tasks.

## Development Space

Technology stack: Code-server, Node.js, Typescript, Docker, K8s

This is a project that allows developers to run their development environment in a browser. Developers can perform development tasks anywhere using just a browser, without the need to install development tools locally. The project is deployed using K8s and is built on top of Code-server with additional development using Node.js for the backend.

I am primarily responsible for feature design, development, design reviews, code reviews, and other related tasks.
